  [Intro]
This is, like, the perfect music to think
Hahaha Yeah
It's like elevator music, but you're going to the fiftieth floor
Mmm, made me realise I have no thoughts though
<p>
  [Verse]
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
Which way to go
When I was walkin' through the London city lights
I met the devil and he smiled at me and said, "You're going the wrong way"
(If you never know yourself, you never know, never find)
Your thumbs are idle and they're all mine
Feelings will hurt
Did I say that out loud?
Put my feelings on you
To find out which way should I go
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
Which way to go
When I was walkin' through the London city lights
I met the dеvil and he smiled at me and said, "You'rе going the wrong way"
(If you never know yourself, you never know, never find)
Your thumbs are idle and they're all mine
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
I am so perfect
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
Did I say that out loud?
</p>
<p>
  [Outro]
One, two, three, hey
I had a good job and I left (Yee)
I had a good job and I left
I left because I thought it was right
Left, right, left, right
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
(Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right)
Which way to go
I learnt on Twitter
Da-da-di-da-do-do-do, I don't know which way to go
There's the whole "I want to be a rockstar's girlfriend"
But yeah, the difference between (Rockstar's girlfriend?)
Me and all those tweets is that
You're not like those
I'm the rockstar, not my boyfriend
I'm not the rockstar's girlfriend, I am the rockstar girlfriend
Do you get what I mean?
Mm-hm, the girlfriend who is a rockstar
Like, I'm not the accessory to the rockstar, I'm the rockstar
Do you get what I mean?

But yet I still feel the same
Doing yoga just to feel untethered, but my mind keeps

Always wanted to be best at everything
Even when it brings out the worst in myself (Worst in myself)
So I create a storm and bury it deep, hiding the key

Oh, I'm in a cyclone, I'm spinning
Crashed through the floor
Don't give me heaven, I'm flying
Tearing down the doors of this city
Ooh, you know I'm running, I'm running
Running into hurricanes

  Hey, hey-hey
  Used to like the drama, baby, I don't anymore
  If you got some trouble, baby, leave it at the door
  Hey, hey-hey (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
</p>
<p>
  [Pre-Chorus]
  No, we (We)
  Don't (Don't)
  Have (Have)
  To get emotional
</p>
<p>
  [Chorus]
You'll never love somebody like me
You'll never love somebody like me
You'll never love, you'll never love
You'll never love somebody like me
You'll never love somebody like me
And you could be somebody I need
You'll never love, you'll never love
You'll never love somebody like me
<p>
  [Outro]
You'll never love somebody like me
You'll never love somebody like me
You'll never love, you'll never love
You'll never love somebody like me
You'll never love somebody like me
And you could be somebody I need
You'll never love, you'll never love
You'll never love somebody like me

<h2 id="maniac">MANIAC - Macklemore (feat. Windser) </h2>
<p>
  [Chorus: Windser]
I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
I could give a damn, you're a maniac
And you're talkin' like a killer, got me on my back
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
<p>
  [Verse 1: Macklemore]
I fell in love with her moonwalk
Dancin' in the kitchen in her tube socks
I shoulda saw the signs, but refused, dawg
How am I supposed to ever move on?
Why is this so complicated? You said that you didn't love me
Said you workin' on yourself, you ain't been to therapy since 2020
Somethin' isn't right, see it in your eyes
Always give advice, never takin' mine
When I say goodnight, I'm thinkin'
</p>
<p>
  [Pre-Chorus: Macklemore & Windser]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You get on my nerves, I'm a foo-ooh-ooh-ool
You better reimburse all the things you do-ooh-ohh
Put me in a hearse, we both coo-coo-coo-cool
It's never gonna work
</p>
<p>
  [Chorus: Windser]
  I don't wanna dance with a maniac
  'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
  You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
  I could give a damn, you're a maniac
  And you're talkin' like a killer, got me on my back
  You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
<p>
  [Verse 2: Macklemore]
I think we need some space, I think we need a break
I think I need to move, I think this isn't safe
Why the hell you follow me to Walmart?
Gotta know everything, you ain't Nardwuar
Dress up on Friday nights, turn up 'til Sunday mornin'
I'm Mr. Probably Right, ignorin' all the warnings
I shouldn't wanna kick it, too many red flags
I knew you were problematic 'cause all of your exes are mad
Somehow, I'm back in your arms, told you, "Get back in my car"
I know you don't really love me, you deserve actin' awards
As long as the night is young, go crazy, I got your back
I'll be posted by the jukebox watchin' you dance, thinkin'
</p>
<p>
  [Pre-Chorus: Macklemore & Windser]
  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
  You get on my nerves, I'm a foo-ooh-ooh-ool
  You better reimburse all the things you do-ooh-ohh
  Keep me down to Earth, we're both coo-coo-coo-cool
  But somehow it works, let's go
</p>
<p>
  [Chorus: Windser]
I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
I could give a damn, you're a maniac
And you're talkin' like a killer, got me on my back
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
<p>
[Outro: Windser]
I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah

<h2 id="substance">SUBSTANCE - Demi Lovato </h2>
<p>
  [Verse 1]
  Is anybody happy with life in the backseat?
  Trying to master the art of detaching
  Is anybody driving? Is anyone asking?
  Is anyone grasping that nothing lasts?
<p>
  [Pre-Chorus]
Woah
I know we're all fucking exhausted
Woah
Am I in my head or have we all lost it?
</p>
<p>
  [Chorus]
  So I ask myself
  "Am I the only one looking for substance?"
  Got high, it only left me lonely and loveless
  Don't wanna end up in a casket, head full of maggots
  Body full of jack shit, I get in abundance
  Am I the only one looking for substance?
</p>
<p>
  [Verse 2]
  I don't remember last week, got my head scratching
  But everyone's acting like nothing is lacking
  I think we might be crashing, everyone's laughing
  Time is just passing, yet nothing lasts
<p>
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Woah
  I know we're all fucking exhausted
  Woah
  Am I in my head or have we all lost it?
</p>
<p>
  [Chorus]
  So I ask myself
  "Am I the only one looking for substance?"
  Got high, it only left me lonely and loveless
  Don't wanna end up in a casket, head full of maggots
  Body full of jack shit, I get in abundance
  Am I the only one looking for substance?
</p>
<p>
  [Bridge]
  Am I talking to myself?
  Is anyone out there screaming at the walls?
  I can't relate at all, relate at all
  Fuck the theatrics, what happened to classic?
  Give me the real shit, give me the magic
<p>
  [Chorus]
  So I ask myself
  "Am I the only one looking for substance?"
  Got high, it only left me lonely and loveless
  (Don't wanna end up in a) Casket
  (Head full of) Maggots
  (Body full of) Jack shit
  (I get in) Abundance
  Am I the only one looking for substance?
</p>
<p>
  [Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
